# DungeonRush
My piece of work from C assignment. Hope you like it :)

*I work on the small project on my own so the code lacks of comments.*
## Dependencies
The project requires no more than common SDL2 libraries.
`SDL2, SDL2-ttf, SDL2-image, SDL2-mixer`
### For Arch
```
$ pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf
```
### For other OS
The names of packages should be similiar. You can look for SDL tutorial to set up the environment.
## Compilation
**You should make sure all dependencies are installed before compiling**
```
$ make
```
## License and Credits
DungeonRush has mixed meida with 
various licenses. Unfortunately I failed to track them all. In other word, there are many stuff excluding code that comes with unknown license. You should not reuse any of audio, bitmaps, font in this project. If you insist, use at your own risk.
